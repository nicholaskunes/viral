# viral

Viral is a "grey hat" Windows NT takeover kit. The intent of this project is non-malicious but the nature of Viral is a complete takeover of the core OS. You are not to use Viral in any malicious format. Viral is intended for education purposes for everyone (myself especially) in learning how to effectivley program a full virus suite.
